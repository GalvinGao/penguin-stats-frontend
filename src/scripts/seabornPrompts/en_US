...Ishar-mla, La-tina, Louu-tina, Laren-tina......?
......Gla-dia......
...I want to see. Are you free?
Friends are here. They are trapped. Need help. Should be returned to our kin's embrace.
Many friends have died here. But Parents. Will not let them die. I must save them.
Return to the great sea. No need to fight.
We go, together—
...Gla-dia, will you prey on me?
If you feed on me, will that make you stronger? More full of life?
Will it help the scales on your neck grow and spread, and return you to your proper form?
I sever... this flesh. Consume it.
If you need more, I give you more. I will give you everything.
...We will meet again soon.
You, are not scaleless. Do you need food?
Sufficient nutrition. But these waters, are still incomplete. The Cycle has not yet been built, and living things die in vain.
We must hurry—
—Why? Hunting, meaningless. There is something we must do, a duty to our kin.
We are bound by blood. You hunt and eat us, you will become us. Just as our Parents hunted you, and then became hunted by you.
To hunt is to survive. There is no good or evil in the hunt.
Hunt, feed. But that is not what you are doing. Your goal is constantly changing. Shaking. Yes, shaking.
You are... not hungry.
...Leave. We will meet again.
...Kin. Scaleless?
Kin are here. In need of help.
Accept? Identity?
Need time. And nutrition.
I do not abandon. Kin.
I need time. But not much more.
I will be back. We will meet again.
Strong. Work together, and you are strong enough to lead our kind.
But, you do not plan to do this. This puzzles me.
Our kind, how will you treat them?
Willpower, begets all. Any chasm, can be crossed.
Our environment, complete and pure. Impurities, are not needed.
About parents, I am trying to find an answer. Yet the question, is not clear. I cannot ask yet.
(Sound of bones grinding and rubbing)
...Fighting, is meaningless.
Leaving, is the correct choice.
Language, you also know it.
Efficiency, relatively low. Not enough information, not enough time. If necessary, I will complete it.
Kindred, you have formed your own group. And your offspring, consume one another.
You, are incomplete.
Kindred, no point in nurturing.
Flesh and blood, donate to us.
Survival, is not actually your goal. Perhaps, you can become something greater.
Nowhere, Laurentina. The ocean is boundless, and wherever we go is all the same.
Laurentina, that is the name of our scaleless kin, the Liberi, the Iberian.
As I consumed her, she kept stroking my head. She spoke to me of many things. Time itself was like frozen dust, an eternity seeming to pass as I listened to her.
Until she could no longer speak, until even her bones were digested by our smallest kin, she nurtured me with both nutrition and time. She taught me everything I know.
Such was her request, I merely granted it. If there is purpose to such emotions, we are willing to experiment.
What of Ishar'mla? Gladiia? And... Ulpianus?
Are your kin ready to return to the great sea?
Why? Your home is clearly right before your eyes. We many are clearly right here awaiting you.
You're homesick, Laurentina. Amaia told me that, of all the Ægir she ever made contact with, you harbor the greatest affection for Ægir itself.
Embrace me, and I will bring you back home.
Just as you prefer to give shape to inorganic matter, even though it offers nothing for your survival?
Pursuits? Like your pursuit to return home?
The survival of our kind. The survival of more of us. The survival of we many.
All beings ought to form a single entity. Life should not be so disorderly.
It was just her request. A memento.
...Ah, before her death, Amaia entrusted you to me. I will make use of your life. I will also fulfill your requests.
Amaia thanks you. She said I should help you. Because of you, their work was able to take another step forward. Their 'research' and 'ideals' have all advanced greatly.
I can talk to you about Ishar'mla. I can take you back to Ægir. I can share with you where our kind are, and how they are doing. I can name your clansmen who are trying to become one with us.
Amaia begged me to help you. Only through helping you, will you accept us as kin.
Very well.
A sufficiently heavy blow. Our kin in the ocean will welcome his unconscious form. They will take him back to our nest, where we will spend time becoming one with him.
As for this floating box... it has been used to house our kin who have not yet adapted to the sea. But most of them died, and the rest have refused to become one with us.
Therefore, it is no longer needed.
Come, let us return to the sea.
Whether to hunt, or to communicate, or to evolve, we must all return to the sea.
What a paradoxical being. You have consumed many of our kin, yet many more go hungry. You ought to feed them.
Turn into nutrients, and nourish our kind.
You are not fighting me, Garcia.
You are fighting we many inside your heart. You are on this ship, but you thirst for the sea.
But it doesn't matter.
Become sustenance, and nourish our kin. Or, become one with us.
Human, kin, and all living things in between.
Amaia wishes to correct you. And thus, it shall be done. I simply welcome back my kin, and welcome back Ishar-mla.
Protect the lives of our kin. Then, return to we many. 'Return home.'
There are many among us who wish to see you. Ishar-mla. Ishar'mla.
Our kind awaits you. We await you. We hope you will answer our call.
Soon, many kin, many kin in need, will reach my heights.
We are changing every day. Gladiia. We are one whole. You are of the strongest batch.
Please, my kin, even more of our kin call out to me, asking me to maintain the ocean's growth and tranquility.
If you get in my way, I have no choice but to consume you. I beg of you, return to our kind.
...If you insist on calling me that.
A debt? If you are willing to return to our kind, I will grant you that.
...Minutes. Yes, your kind's conception of time. Amaia spoke of this before.
Ten minutes.
In ten minutes this box will be surrounded by our kin. It will 'sink.'
As long as even one of our kin touches upon the ultimate answer to life, we will be able to re-weave the laws of the cosmos from beginning to end.
Before we are given our next Revelation, we shall find a way.
Even if Ishar'mla refuses to answer. Even if our kind will never know the divine Will.
We will still survive.
Our kin have conveyed their will. Nutrients are sufficient. No longer must we feed on each other.
I should return to the nest. You should come with me.
Our kind calls me back. They call for me to share my fruits with them.
I shall heed their call. When that is done, I shall heed your call. I shall seek you out, and you shall kill me.
Ishar-mla. I've always wanted to meet you.
What happened? Why doesn't He speak anymore? Where is He?
Are you Him? Is He you?
Death. Withering. He exists beyond these concepts. His voice, by no means signifies the end of life.
No. This is what we call Him—
Ishar-mla. Once more, I feel His pulse.
Kin. You swam together to His abode in the abyss, where even death drowns.
We have lost contact with Him, but His choices can only lead to the future.
Kin, your information... Nay, the flow of your emotions.
You feel it, Ishar-mla. Because you have left the arid land and returned home.
Our blood flows in your veins. His blood flows in your veins. You are Him.
No matter. As you say, thus you are. Abyssal Hunter, Ska-di.
Ishar-mla, we await His answer. Be it on the other end of time, He will answer us.
Until then, until our answer finally comes—
—We many shall live on.
Nngh—!
You are pitifully weak, human. Even as nutrition, you are not enough to nourish our kin.
Now that nutrients are plentiful, we require only time.
This place is far from your territory. You have no reason to interfere with us.
Law? Burdensome rules of survival, as Amaia once said.
Compared to our kin, you are indeed too weak.
Emotional. How strange, human. You are so weak, driven by emotions, trying to escape my hunger.
Escape, yes. Escape. Fear? But why do you still stand here then? Why do you attack me? Why... do you not flee from me?
Do you... also wish to make a contribution to 'we many'?
You both, paradoxical beings. You still refuse to become our kin.
You have eaten many of us. Yet you refuse to become part of us.
...Make your choice. Not much time remains.
Hunt, acquire nutrients, return to we many.
Or, cease your bodily movements, give up the gift of life, and pass it on to our other kin.
(Limbs twitch)
(Convulsing) Lauren...
(Quivers with torn muscles)
Ishar-mla. I will bring you all, back home.
The waters, make you nostalgic. Swim, and you will awaken.
Accept it. You are one of we many. We have long awaited you.
Then why did you stop swimming? Your signal is just like mine.
Your wounds have all healed. You are accepting who you are.
Why no?
Glub... (sounds of bubbles being blown) Gurgle... (sounds of bubbles popping)
Ul...pianus... Kin...
My blood and your blood are identical.
You smell my scent, exactly as we smell your scent.
You find us, kill us...
When we do not understand, we kill you too.
We feed the ocean. Our bodies have provided for the ocean.
Ishar-mla, we possess the same home.
(Earsplitting screech) —!!
Gla-dia...
Kin, I've come for you.
To hunt and consume, is an important matter.
You, are not all kin. But I know, you can still return to our kind.
So I ask, what will you do?
Hunting, must be done.
Purpose, to mold the environment.
You, are rich in nutrients.
Ishar-mla, where is He?
Answer. I wish to know.
...Insufficient.
Nutrients. Time. All insufficient.
Ishar-mla, we require answers. But, I can feel His presence.
With words, we shall implore.
Ishar-mla, even if He does not answer, it does not mean, He is not there.
Even if He is not there, it does not mean, that our kind, has lost its way.
Our kind, has found its way. We will, seize our own fate.
Survival, the primary goal.
—Insufficient, far from enough.
But, soon.
...You, prey on blood relatives. Prey on kin.
You, have eaten many.
To consume, is without fault. Food, is plenty.
You, will consume me? You, are inviting me?
Because, information from afar, cannot pass to kin. Language, they do not understand. Vibration of air, utterance of sound, understanding of rules, learning of language.
...You consume me, I consume you.
Feeding, has continued for too long. Must be ended.
gurgle... Ishar-mla... You will, consume.
(Screeching howl)
You, in this dry, floating vessel... on this ship, hunt. You, left our kind.
Death, does not benefit our kind. Your death, also does not benefit our kind.
... (Blood gurgles in its throat) Grrrgh...
...Scaleless, kin.
Wounds, can't be healed. No way, to nourish our kind.
They all, attack. Attack, but not to hunt.
...You, also hurt.
You, consume me.
Kin, you live.
Our kind, will continue, and survive.
Virtue...? Noble...?
